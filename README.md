# GetNtGlobalFlags

WTF?!?
------
Retrieves the value of PEB.NtGlobalFlags, which is well-known method to detect a user mode
debugger, via a high-level implementation that is portable between x86 and x64 architectures.

This is achieved by taking advantage of an undocumented function exported by Ntdll.dll, named
RtlGetNtGlobalFlags which does exactly what its name implies.

You can use it to compile 32/64-bit applications without going through low level assembly,
which requires adjusting the offsets between 32 and 64-bit buids of your binaries.

Another advantage of using this method is that if the relative offset of PEB.NtGlobalFlags
change, as long as the aforementioned function is exported by Ntdll, this method will still
work.

There is also a fail safe in case RtlGetNtGlobalFlags is removed from the exported functions
of Ntdll.dll.

As a side-note, I had initially posted a short version of this as an answer in a private forum,
which later someone copied and pasted in his own public blog. As far as I know he has now removed
it, and so I decided to release it myself since other people might find it useful as well.
